Working most of my life in small startups, I am comfortable with a wide range of responsibilities: keeping my main focus on Software Engineering, I often get into lateral professions like data science, user experience design, service design, marketing and even accountancy. This helps me to see the bigger picture and make overall better decisions.

Hire me if you:

\begin{cvlistitems}
  \item Need a creative, enthusiastic and original thinker in your team.
  \item Are okay with me asking many questions even though some may seem uncomfortable.
  \item Put people over processes and trust people working with you.
\end{cvlistitems}

Iâ€™m not a good candidate if you:

\begin{cvlistitems}
  \item Need a person whom you tell exactly what needs to be done.
  \item Need a person who solves the same problem, in the same way, many times.
  \item Genuinely prefer short-term solutions over long-term ones.
\end{cvlistitems}
