    {Principal Lead Development Engineer} % Job title

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Designed and coded Meeting System from the backend to the frontend with full support of business requirements: custom rules for accessing invitations, recurrence, multiple time zones. By using approaches from Domain Driven Design, reduced data inconsistency and simplified the usage of Meeting System for other developers.}
        \item {Designed and coded Payment System for running per-feature sales with support of different billing cycles, upgrades and cancellations of packages with the usage of Stripe API.}
        \item {Explored, experimented with and communicated various architectural changes to the app, which included: designing API and integration between frontend and backend, modularising and componentizing code on frontend and backend, finding suitable approaches for data management and many more. Having these things done helped us to build features faster and avoid solving the same problem multiple times.}
        \item {Mentored team members, helped them to upskill and develop their talents. This included careful observing, pair programming, running workshops, code reviews, facilitating brainstorming sessions, making reading recommendations. As a result, we had a shared understanding of the codebase and our approaches.}
        \item {Planned and managed the effort of CI build time-optimisation. This reduced average waiting time for builds from 4 hours to 30 minutes and average running time from 1 hour to 35 minutes without spending extra budget. As a result, developers started getting quicker feedback for their changes.}
        \item {Explored, experimented with and managed the effort of changing frontend builds to use Bazel. This led to reducing the round-trip time between saving code and seeing changes from over a minute to 10 seconds. As a result, we got better developers’ engagement and we started to write better code.}
        \item {Created a few small services to make developers' life easier: a UI-kit app, a system for catching and tracing errors, automatic security audits, in-house performance monitoring and others.}
